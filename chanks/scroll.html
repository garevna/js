Why ECMAScript Decorators instead of JavaScript Decorators in the title?
Because, ECMAScript is a standard for writing scripting languages
like JavaScript, it doesn’t enforce JavaScript to support all the specs
but a JavaScript engine (used by different browsers)
may or may not support a feature introduced in ECMAScript
or support with little different behaviour

Consider ECMAScript as language that you speak for example, English

Then JavaScript would be a dialect like British English

A dialect is a language itself but it is based on principals
of the language it was derived from

So, ECMAScript is a cookbook for cooking/writing JavaScript
and it’s upto the chef/developer to follow all ingredients/rules or not

Generally, JavaScript adopters follow all the specifications
written in language (or developers will go crazy)
and ship it very late with the new version of JavaScript engine
until they make sure that everything is working well

TC39 or Technical Committee 39 at ECMA International
is responsible for maintaining ECMAScript language specifications

Members of this team belongs to ECMA International,
browser vendors and companies interested in web in general

As ECMAScript is open standard, anybody can suggest new ideas
or features and work on them

Hence, a proposal for new feature goes through 4 main stages and TC39
gets involved in this process until that feature is ready to be shipped
