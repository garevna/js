Why ECMAScript Decorators instead of JavaScript Decorators in the title? 
Because, ECMAScript is a standard for writing scripting languages 
like JavaScript, it doesn’t enforce JavaScript to support all the specs 
but a JavaScript engine (used by different browsers) 
may or may not support a feature introduced in ECMAScript 
or support with little different behaviour
        
Consider ECMAScript as language that you speak for example, English
        
Then JavaScript would be a dialect like British English
        
A dialect is a language itself but it is based on principals 
of the language it was derived from
        
So, ECMAScript is a cookbook for cooking/writing JavaScript 
and it’s upto the chef/developer to follow all ingredients/rules or not
        
Generally, JavaScript adopters follow all the specifications 
written in language (or developers will go crazy) 
and ship it very late with the new version of JavaScript engine 
until they make sure that everything is working well
        
TC39 or Technical Committee 39 at ECMA International 
is responsible for maintaining ECMAScript language specifications
        
Members of this team belongs to ECMA International, 
browser vendors and companies interested in web in general
        
As ECMAScript is open standard, anybody can suggest new ideas 
or features and work on them
        
Hence, a proposal for new feature goes through 4 main stages and TC39 
gets involved in this process until that feature is ready to be shipped
