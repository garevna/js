Literals for One, Factories for Many

If you need to create many objects, you’ll want to combine the power of object literals and factory functions.

With a factory function, you can create as many user objects as you want.

If you’re building a chat app, for instance, you can have a user object representing the current user, and also a lot of other user objects representing all the other users who are currently signed in and chatting, so you can display their names and avatars, too.
