Just as you can use generators to create iterator factories, you can use async generators to create async iterator factories.

Async generators a mixture of async functions and generators.

Let's say we wanted to create an iterator that returned random numbers, but those random numbers came from a web service:

// Note the * after "function"

async function* asyncRandomNumbers() {

  // This is a web service that returns a random number
  const url = 'https://www.random.org/decimal-fractions/?num=1&dec=10&col=1&format=plain&rnd=new';

  while (true) {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const text = await response.text();
    yield Number(text);
  }
}
